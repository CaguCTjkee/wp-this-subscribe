# Hello world

This is my first *free* plugin. He is really simple for now, but for future he will be powerful.

### Installing

Just download zip file from github and upload from wp-admin from a plugin-install page.
After installation activate the plugin. Now you can use him, manage the subscribers, change templates, etc.

On frontend site you should use short code [thisSubscribe] for display subscriber form.

```
[thisSubscribe]
```

Also plugin will make new page, so users can unsubscribe.
